## Next Steps

Further steps I would like to make to my app are:
create unique styling to the home page and game information pages, I would like to add even more information about a game as well as there developers history, I would like to make a users favorite page, 
add a drop down option for main links that would lead to more specififc links Ex. 'Top Rated Games', And I would like to touch up my about page.
